## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript
- **Backend:** Web Sockets for real-time multiplayer interactions
- **Blockchain:** Solidity for smart contract development

## Features

- **Blockchain Integration:** Secure and transparent transactions using Ethereum.
- **ERC20 & ERC721 Implementation:** In-game currency (ERC20) and properties as NFTs (ERC721).
- **Multi-player Compatibility:** Play with friends in real-time using WebSockets.
- **Decentralized Transactions:** Eliminates intermediaries and ensures fair gameplay.
- **Smart Contracts:** Automates property purchases, rent payments, and token distribution.
- **Fullscreen Mode:** Enhanced user experience with an immersive interface.

## Why Blockopoly?

Traditional online Monopoly games rely on centralized servers, which can be manipulated. Blockopoly solves this issue by:
- Ensuring **transparency** with blockchain transactions.
- Providing **true ownership** of in-game assets via NFTs.
- Making transactions **immutable and secure** with smart contracts.
- Offering a **decentralized gaming experience** without intermediaries.

## How It Works

1. Players start with a fixed amount of **Monopoly Money (ERC20 tokens).**
2. When a player buys a property, an **NFT (ERC721)** is minted and assigned to them.
3. Rent and transactions are **automatically processed via smart contracts.**
4. The game follows the **traditional Monopoly rules** but with blockchain-backed transactions.

## What You Need to Play

- A **MetaMask wallet** (or any Web3-enabled wallet)
- Some **Ethereum (ETH) for gas fees**
- A **deployed version of Blockopoly** (or run it locally)
