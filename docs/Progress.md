### **🎯 Monopoly Game - Blockchain-Based Design Plan**  
This project aims to implement a **Monopoly game** using **Ethereum smart contracts** with **ERC-20 for in-game currency** and **ERC-721 for property ownership**. Players can buy, sell, and rent properties using blockchain transactions.  

---

## **1️⃣ Plan Overview (Frontend + Smart Contracts)**
### **📌 Smart Contracts Architecture**
1. **MonopolyToken (ERC-20)**
   - Used as in-game currency (e.g., MNY tokens)
   - The Bank contract distributes initial money to players
   - Players can pay the bank (for properties, taxes, etc.) or other players (rent)
   - Implements `mint`, `transfer`, and `burn` functions

2. **MonopolyProperty (ERC-721)**
   - Each property is an NFT (unique property on the board)
   - The bank initially owns properties and sells them to players
   - Players can trade properties with each other
   - Implements property registration, transfers, and mortgage system

3. **Bank Contract (Manager of Board)**
   - Deploys new game boards  
   - Controls the flow of tokens  
   - Registers properties and assigns ownership  
   - Handles property sales, rents, and bankrupt players  

---

### **📌 Frontend Architecture**
1. **Game Setup & Login**
   - Players connect their wallets using **Metamask**
   - Players join a game board by entering a **Board ID**
   - The bank distributes starting money to each player

2. **Gameplay**
   - Players roll dice to move around the board
   - If they land on an unowned property, they can buy it from the bank
   - If they land on an owned property, they must pay rent  
   - Players can trade properties with other players  

3. **Bank & Transactions**
   - Bank handles property purchases and tax payments  
   - Players send **ERC-20 tokens** to the bank or other players for rent  
   - Players can mortgage their properties for extra money  
   - If a player goes bankrupt, their properties return to the bank

## **2️⃣ What Have We Done So Far?**
✅ **Implemented ERC-20 Token (MonopolyToken)**
   - Created `MonopolyToken` contract  
   - Minted money for the bank  
   - Distributed money to players  
   - Implemented transactions (pay bank, pay players, burn bankrupt money)  

✅ **Implemented ERC-721 Token (MonopolyProperty)**
   - Created `MonopolyProperty` contract  
   - Registered properties as NFTs  
   - Implemented transfer of ownership  
   - Implemented mortgage system  

✅ **Installed Dependencies**
   - Installed **OpenZeppelin** for security  
   - Installed **Hardhat** and **Remix** for contract development  

---

## **3️⃣ What Needs to Be Done?**
### **🛠 Smart Contracts**
🔲 **Implement a "Bank Contract" to manage game boards**  
   - Store details about **each board** (properties, players, and funds)  
   - Register and initialize properties for each board  
   - Distribute tokens to players automatically  

🔲 **Enhance ERC-20 Token Functionality**  
   - Prevent over-spending using require statements  
   - Implement an **admin-controlled minting** function for new games  

🔲 **Enhance ERC-721 Property Management**  
   - Ensure property transfers only occur if the player has enough money  
   - Implement an **auction system** for selling properties  
   - Implement **property upgrades (houses & hotels)**  

---

### **🎨 Frontend Development**
🔲 **Wallet Connection**
   - Use **Metamask** to allow players to sign in  

🔲 **Game UI**
   - Show Monopoly board layout with **properties, player tokens, and balance**  
   - Display **player transactions (rent, purchases, trades)**  

🔲 **Gameplay Mechanics**
   - Implement **rolling dice** feature  
   - Track **player movements and positions** on the board  
   - Allow players to buy properties when landing on an unowned tile  
   - Deduct rent payments automatically when landing on an owned tile  

🔲 **Blockchain Integration**
   - Use **ethers.js** to call smart contract functions  
   - Implement **real-time updates** using events  

---

## **📌 Next Steps**
1️⃣ **Write the Bank Contract** (Smart contract for board management)  
2️⃣ **Test All Smart Contracts on Local Hardhat Network**  
3️⃣ **Deploy Contracts on a Testnet (Goerli, Sepolia, Mumbai)**  
4️⃣ **Start Frontend Development with React & Ethers.js**  
5️⃣ **Integrate Gameplay Mechanics (Rolling Dice, Buying Properties, Paying Rent)**  

---

This structure will allow us to create a **fully functional Monopoly blockchain game**! 🚀  
Let me know if you need modifications or additional details. 😊

### **📌 Understanding Your Smart Contracts and What Needs to be Built**  

Right now, you've implemented **ERC-20 (MonopolyToken)** for in-game currency and **ERC-721 (MonopolyProperty)** for property ownership. However, additional contracts are required to manage the game effectively. Below is a detailed breakdown of what you have and what needs to be built.

---

## **1️⃣ Smart Contracts You’ve Built So Far**
### **✅ MonopolyToken (ERC-20) — In-game Currency**  
This contract manages the in-game currency (Monopoly Money - `MNY` tokens).  

📌 **Why was it built?**
- Players need **tokens** to perform transactions (buy property, pay rent, etc.).
- The **bank** mints and distributes money to players.
- Players can **send money** to other players and the bank.

📌 **What does it do?**
✔️ Mints money for each **game board**.  
✔️ Distributes money to **players** when the game starts.  
✔️ Allows players to **pay rent and taxes** to the bank.  
✔️ Allows players to **transfer money** to each other (trading, rent, etc.).  
✔️ Allows the **bank to burn** a bankrupt player’s balance.  

---
### **✅ MonopolyProperty (ERC-721) — Property Ownership**  
This contract manages properties as **NFTs**, ensuring each property is unique.

📌 **Why was it built?**
- Properties need to be **owned and traded** uniquely.
- The bank initially owns all properties and **sells** them to players.
- Players need a way to **sell or trade properties** with each other.

📌 **What does it do?**
✔️ Mints **NFT properties** at game creation.  
✔️ Assigns initial property ownership to **the bank**.  
✔️ Allows players to **buy properties from the bank**.  
✔️ Allows **transfers of properties** between players.  
✔️ Implements **a mortgage system** (players can mortgage properties for extra money).  

---
## **2️⃣ Contracts That Need to Be Built**
### **🆕 Bank Contract — Game Board & Game Logic**  
The **Bank contract** will act as the **game controller**, managing game state and player interactions.

📌 **Why is it needed?**
- We need a way to **track multiple game boards** (each board has different players & properties).
- The **bank should control the game flow** (distribute money, register properties, handle bankrupt players).
- Players **should not directly call the ERC-20 or ERC-721 contracts**—instead, they interact with the **Bank contract**, which acts as an intermediary.

📌 **What will it do?**
🔹 Deploy new **game boards** (each board is separate).  
🔹 Register **players and properties** for each board.  
🔹 Handle **player bankruptcies** and return properties to the bank.  
🔹 Control **property purchases** (ensure the player has enough funds before transferring ownership).  
🔹 Control **rent collection** (ensure correct payments between players).  

---
### **🆕 Dice Roll Contract (Optional) — Fair Randomness**
This contract ensures **fair and transparent dice rolls** for the game.

📌 **Why is it needed?**
- Players move based on dice rolls, which should be **provably random**.
- On-chain randomness needs to be **secure and unpredictable**.

📌 **What will it do?**
🔹 Generate **random dice rolls** securely using **Chainlink VRF** or a similar service.  
🔹 Store **dice results** on-chain to prevent cheating.  
🔹 Ensure that each **player’s move is fair and tamper-proof**.  

---
### **🆕 Auction & Trade Contract (Optional) — Property Bidding & Trades**
This contract allows players to **sell properties via auction** or **trade properties with each other**.

📌 **Why is it needed?**
- Players should be able to **auction properties** when they want to sell.  
- The **highest bidder** should win the property.  
- Players should be able to **trade properties directly**.  

📌 **What will it do?**
🔹 Allow players to **list a property for sale** and set a starting price.  
🔹 Let other players **place bids** within a time window.  
🔹 Transfer the property to the **highest bidder**.  
🔹 Allow direct **property swaps** between players.

## **3️⃣ Summary of What’s Built vs. What’s Needed**
| Contract | Status | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **MonopolyToken (ERC-20)** | ✅ Done | Handles in-game money (minting, transactions, bankruptcies). |
| **MonopolyProperty (ERC-721)** | ✅ Done | Manages property ownership (NFTs) for buying, selling, and trading. |
| **Bank Contract** | ❌ Needs to be built | Manages game flow (players, properties, transactions, bankruptcies). |
| **Dice Roll Contract** | ❌ Optional | Ensures fair and tamper-proof dice rolls. |
| **Auction & Trade Contract** | ❌ Optional | Enables property auctions and trades between players. |

---

## **📌 Next Steps**
🔹 **Step 1:** Build the **Bank Contract** (core game logic).  
🔹 **Step 2:** Integrate the Bank Contract with MonopolyToken & MonopolyProperty.  
🔹 **Step 3:** Deploy & test the game logic using Hardhat or Remix.  
🔹 **Step 4:** Optionally implement Dice Roll and Auction Contracts.  

---
### **🚀 Final Thoughts**
- Right now, you **only have the ERC-20 and ERC-721 assets**, but the game **doesn’t have logic** for managing players, properties, and transactions.  
- The **Bank contract** is the most important missing part.  
- Once the **Bank contract is built**, we can start writing the **frontend** to connect everything together.
