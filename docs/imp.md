That makes sense! You can handle core **game logic** on the frontend while keeping the **critical financial and ownership transactions** on-chain using **smart contracts**. Below is a **high-level plan** for implementing the essential functions in your smart contract.  

---

## **Essential Smart Contract Functions for Monopoly Web3**
Your contract should be written in Solidity and deployed on **Ethereum or any EVM-compatible blockchain (Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, etc.)**.  

### **1. Register Property** (For Tokenized Property Ownership)  
Each property will be an **NFT (ERC-721)** or part of a **mapping** in the contract.  
```solidity
mapping(uint => Property) public properties;
uint public propertyCount;

struct Property {
    uint id;
    string name;
    uint price;
    uint rent;
    address owner;
    bool isOwned;
    bool isMortgaged;
}

function registerProperty(string memory name, uint price, uint rent) external onlyOwner {
    propertyCount++;
    properties[propertyCount] = Property(propertyCount, name, price, rent, address(0), false, false);
}
```
- **Only Admin (Game Owner) can register new properties** before the game starts.

---

### **2. Buy Property** (For Players to Purchase Unowned Properties)  
```solidity
function buyProperty(uint propertyId) external payable {
    Property storage prop = properties[propertyId];
    require(prop.isOwned == false, "Property already owned");
    require(msg.value >= prop.price, "Insufficient funds");

    prop.owner = msg.sender;
    prop.isOwned = true;

    payable(owner).transfer(msg.value); // Send funds to game treasury
    emit PropertyPurchased(propertyId, msg.sender, prop.price);
}
```
- **Requires player to send ETH** to buy the property.  
- **Ownership is recorded in the contract**.  

---

### **3. Pay Rent** (For Charging Rent When a Player Lands on Owned Property)  
```solidity
function payRent(uint propertyId) external payable {
    Property storage prop = properties[propertyId];
    require(prop.isOwned, "Property not owned");
    require(msg.sender != prop.owner, "You own this property");
    require(msg.value >= prop.rent, "Insufficient rent amount");

    payable(prop.owner).transfer(msg.value);
    emit RentPaid(propertyId, msg.sender, prop.owner, msg.value);
}
```
- **Ensures rent goes to the property owner**.  
- **Requires the correct amount of ETH to be sent**.  

---

### **4. Trade Property** (For Players to Trade Properties Among Themselves)  
```solidity
function tradeProperty(uint propertyId, address newOwner, uint tradeAmount) external {
    Property storage prop = properties[propertyId];
    require(prop.isOwned, "Property not owned");
    require(msg.sender == prop.owner, "Not the owner");

    prop.owner = newOwner;
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(tradeAmount); // Buyer sends ETH to the seller
    emit PropertyTraded(propertyId, msg.sender, newOwner, tradeAmount);
}
```
- **Allows players to trade properties directly**.  
- **Transfers ownership and ETH accordingly**.  

---

### **5. Upgrade Property** (To Build Houses & Hotels, Increasing Rent)  
```solidity
struct Upgrade {
    uint houses;
    uint hotels;
}

mapping(uint => Upgrade) public upgrades;

function upgradeProperty(uint propertyId) external payable {
    require(properties[propertyId].owner == msg.sender, "Not the owner");
    require(msg.value >= 0.1 ether, "Insufficient funds for upgrade");

    if (upgrades[propertyId].houses < 4) {
        upgrades[propertyId].houses += 1;
        properties[propertyId].rent += properties[propertyId].rent / 2; // Increase rent by 50%
    } else {
        upgrades[propertyId].houses = 0;
        upgrades[propertyId].hotels = 1;
        properties[propertyId].rent *= 2; // Double rent when hotel is built
    }

    emit PropertyUpgraded(propertyId, msg.sender, properties[propertyId].rent);
}
```
- **Allows property upgrades for higher rent collection**.  
- **Players must pay ETH to upgrade**.  

---

### **6. Send Money Between Players** (For Trades, Deals, or Paying Fees)  
```solidity
function sendMoney(address to, uint amount) external payable {
    require(msg.sender != to, "Cannot send money to yourself");
    require(msg.value == amount, "Incorrect amount sent");

    payable(to).transfer(amount);
    emit MoneySent(msg.sender, to, amount);
}
```
- **Enables direct player-to-player transactions**.  
- **Players can send ETH for trades, fines, or negotiations**.  

---

### **7. Collect Tax (Income Tax, Luxury Tax, etc.)**  
```solidity
uint public treasuryBalance;

function collectTax(uint taxAmount) external payable {
    require(msg.value == taxAmount, "Incorrect tax amount sent");

    treasuryBalance += msg.value;
    emit TaxCollected(msg.sender, taxAmount);
}
```
- **Players pay taxes when required (e.g., landing on tax spaces)**.  
- **Funds go to the game treasury**.  

---

## **Events for Frontend Sync**
Your frontend should listen for these **events** to update the UI in real-time.
```solidity
event PropertyPurchased(uint indexed propertyId, address indexed buyer, uint price);
event RentPaid(uint indexed propertyId, address indexed payer, address indexed owner, uint amount);
event PropertyTraded(uint indexed propertyId, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint amount);
event PropertyUpgraded(uint indexed propertyId, address indexed owner, uint newRent);
event MoneySent(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint amount);
event TaxCollected(address indexed player, uint amount);
```

## **Summary of On-Chain vs Frontend Logic**
| **Function**              | **Smart Contract** | **Frontend**  |
|--------------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Register Property        | ✅ Only Owner  | ❌ Not Needed |
| Buy Property             | ✅ Player Pays | ✅ UI Updates |
| Pay Rent                 | ✅ Auto Transfer | ✅ UI Updates |
| Trade Property           | ✅ Ownership Swap | ✅ UI Updates |
| Upgrade Property         | ✅ Adjusts Rent | ✅ UI Displays |
| Send Money               | ✅ ETH Transfer | ✅ UI Displays |
| Collect Tax              | ✅ Treasury Grows | ✅ UI Updates |
| Roll Dice, Move Player   | ❌ Off-Chain | ✅ Frontend Handles |
| Jail, Chance Cards       | ❌ Off-Chain | ✅ Frontend Handles |
| Game Progression         | ❌ Off-Chain | ✅ Handled by UI |

## **Next Steps**
1. **Deploy on a Testnet (Goerli, Mumbai, or Sepolia)**
2. **Integrate with a Frontend using Web3.js or ethers.js**
3. **Use Chainlink VRF for Randomness (Dice Rolls, Cards)**
4. **Test Transactions & Optimize Gas Fees**
5. **Ensure Security with Audits (Reentrancy, Ownership Checks)**
