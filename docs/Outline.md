## **Hackathon MVP Plan for Web3 Monopoly Game**

---

### **1. Core Features to Focus On**
- **NFT-based properties**:
  - Represent properties as ERC-721 NFTs.
- **Token-based economy**:
  - Implement an ERC-20 token for in-game currency.
- **Game mechanics**:
  - Basic Monopoly board where players can buy properties and pay rent.
- **Web3 wallet integration**:
  - Allow players to connect wallets (e.g., MetaMask).

---

### **2. Tools and Technologies**
#### **Blockchain and Smart Contracts**
- Use **Polygon Mumbai Testnet** (low-cost transactions and fast).
- Tools:
  - **Hardhat** for contract development and testing.
  - **OpenZeppelin** for pre-audited ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards.

#### **Frontend**
- **React.js** with **ethers.js** for blockchain interactions.
- **CSS frameworks**:
  - Use **Tailwind CSS** or **Chakra UI** for quick styling.

#### **Backend**
- Lightweight backend with **Node.js** and **Express.js**.
- **Socket.IO** for real-time updates (optional for MVP).

#### **Database**
- Use **JSON files** or **Firebase** for quick storage of off-chain game data.

---

### **3. Development Roadmap**
#### **Hour 1-3: Setting Up**
1. **Environment setup**:
   - Initialize Hardhat for smart contracts.
   - Create a React project using `create-react-app` or Vite.
2. **Connect wallet**:
   - Integrate MetaMask into your frontend using `ethers.js`.

---

#### **Hour 4-8: Smart Contracts**
1. **ERC-20 Token**:
   - Create and deploy an ERC-20 contract for in-game currency.
   - Example: `MonopolyCoin` (MPC).
2. **ERC-721 NFTs**:
   - Deploy an ERC-721 contract to represent properties.
   - Include metadata like property name, value, and rent.
3. **Game logic contract**:
   - Automate rent payments (e.g., transfer tokens when a player lands on a property).

---

#### **Hour 9-12: Frontend**
1. **Build the board**:
   - Create a simple static Monopoly board (HTML/CSS grid).
2. **Integrate Web3**:
   - Display wallet balance (ERC-20 tokens).
   - Show owned properties (NFTs).
3. **Basic interactivity**:
   - Dice roll simulation.
   - Moving tokens around the board.

---

#### **Hour 13-16: Backend & Real-Time Updates**
1. **Multiplayer logic**:
   - Use **Socket.IO** to sync player turns and moves.
   - Update the board and player data in real time.
2. **Off-chain data storage**:
   - Save game state (e.g., player positions, owned properties) in JSON or Firebase.

---

#### **Hour 17-19: Testing and Debugging**
1. Test smart contracts on **Polygon Mumbai**.
2. Debug Web3 integrations:
   - Wallet connections.
   - Transactions (ERC-20 and ERC-721 interactions).
3. Fix visual bugs and ensure smooth user flow.

---

#### **Hour 20: Polishing and Presentation**
1. Add basic styling for a polished look.
2. Prepare a short demo:
   - Showcase wallet integration, NFT property buying, and token transactions.
3. Focus on presenting the unique Web3 aspects of the game.

---

### **4. Prioritized Features for MVP**
1. **NFT Properties**:
   - Each property is a unique NFT.
   - Demonstrate buying/selling properties using the ERC-20 token.
2. **Token Economy**:
   - Use tokens for transactions (rent, purchases).
3. **Monopoly Board**:
   - A basic interactive board.
4. **Wallet Integration**:
   - Show user token balance and owned properties.

---

### **5. Stretch Goals**
- **Multiplayer**:
  - Real-time updates using Socket.IO.
- **Marketplace**:
  - Allow players to trade properties.
- **Animations**:
  - Dice rolls and token movement.

---

### **6. Key Deliverables**
- **Functional Prototype**:
  - Simple board game with Web3 integration.
- **Demonstrable Features**:
  - NFT minting, token transactions, and wallet interactions.
- **Clear Presentation**:
  - Focus on how Web3 enhances the Monopoly experience.

---

### **7. Tips for Hackathon Success**
1. **Divide Responsibilities**:
   - Frontend, backend, and smart contracts handled in parallel.
2. **Use Templates**:
   - Leverage OpenZeppelin and ready-made React components to save time.
3. **Test Often**:
   - Deploy frequently to testnet and debug as you build.
4. **Focus on Functionality**:
   - Skip advanced features and aim for a working MVP.
