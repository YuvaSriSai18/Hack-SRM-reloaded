## **Detailed Workflow: Monopoly Game using Smart Contracts**  

This document outlines the **step-by-step workflow** for building the Monopoly game, covering the **frontend, backend, and smart contracts**.  

---

## **1️⃣ Frontend Workflow (React + Web3.js / Ethers.js)**  

### **Step 1: User Authentication and Game Setup**  
1. Users **connect their wallets** (Metamask or WalletConnect) using Web3.js or Ethers.js.  
2. Users either **create a new game** or **join an existing game**.  
3. If a new game is created, the frontend calls the **Bank contract** to register the game board and assign the bank.  
4. The game creator invites **other players** to join by sharing the **game ID**.  
5. Each joining player is **registered on-chain** in the Bank contract.  
6. The frontend fetches **game data (players, properties, bank balance, etc.)** from the blockchain.  

---

### **Step 2: Game Start and Money Distribution**  
1. Once all players are ready, the game creator **starts the game** via the frontend.  
2. The frontend calls the **Bank contract** to distribute the **initial MonopolyToken balance** to each player.  
3. The UI updates to show **each player’s balance** and **property ownership status**.  

---

### **Step 3: Player Turn and Dice Roll**  
1. The active player clicks **“Roll Dice”**, triggering a request to the **Dice Roll contract**.  
2. The contract generates a **random dice value** using **Chainlink VRF** or another method.  
3. The dice result is stored on-chain, and the player’s position is updated.  
4. The frontend fetches the new position and **highlights the new tile** on the board.  

---

### **Step 4: Property Purchase & Trading**  
1. If the player lands on an **unowned property**, they can **purchase** it from the **Bank contract**.  
2. If they buy the property, the **MonopolyProperty contract (ERC-721)** transfers ownership to the player.  
3. If the player lands on an **owned property**, they must **pay rent** to the owner.  
4. The frontend calls the **Bank contract**, which handles the transfer of **MonopolyTokens** to the property owner.  
5. Players can **trade properties** via the **Auction & Trade contract**.  

---

### **Step 5: Mortgage & Bankruptcy**  
1. Players can **mortgage properties** to get extra MonopolyTokens from the Bank.  
2. If a player **runs out of money**, their properties return to the bank, and they are marked as **bankrupt**.  
3. The frontend fetches updated balances and player statuses from the blockchain.  

---

### **Step 6: Game End & Winner Declaration**  
1. The game ends when only **one player remains** with money.  
2. The frontend fetches the **final state** from the blockchain and **declares the winner**.  

---

## **2️⃣ Backend Workflow (Node.js / Express + Hardhat for Deployment)**  

### **Step 1: Smart Contract Deployment**  
1. Use **Hardhat** to compile and deploy the following contracts:  
   - **MonopolyToken (ERC-20)**
   - **MonopolyProperty (ERC-721)**
   - **Bank Contract (Game Logic)**
   - **Dice Roll Contract (Randomness)**
   - **Auction & Trade Contract (Property Transactions)**
2. Store deployed contract **addresses** in the frontend for interactions.  

---

### **Step 2: API for Game Management (Optional, Off-Chain Support)**  
If needed, a **Node.js backend** with Express can store off-chain **game metadata**:  
- **Game board details** (game IDs, player addresses, current positions).  
- **Player statistics** (wins, losses, history).  
- **Leaderboard tracking** (player rankings based on game performance).  

---

## **3️⃣ Smart Contract Workflow**  

### **Step 1: MonopolyToken Contract (ERC-20) - In-Game Currency**  
- **Minting Tokens**: The Bank mints an initial supply of tokens.  
- **Distributing Money**: The Bank transfers starting money to each player.  
- **Player Transactions**: Players send money to each other or the bank.  
- **Bankruptcy Handling**: If a player has zero balance, their money is burned.  

---

### **Step 2: MonopolyProperty Contract (ERC-721) - Property Ownership**  
- **Minting Properties**: The Bank mints NFT properties when a game starts.  
- **Buying Properties**: Players send MonopolyTokens to the Bank to claim property NFTs.  
- **Rent Payment**: When a player lands on a property, they transfer tokens to the owner.  
- **Mortgage & Auctions**: Players can mortgage properties or auction them to others.  

---

### **Step 3: Bank Contract - Game Management**  
- **Game Creation**: A new board is created with a unique ID.  
- **Player Registration**: Players join the game and receive their starting money.  
- **Turn Management**: The contract tracks turns and ensures fair play.  
- **Rent Collection**: Players pay rent when landing on an owned property.  
- **Bankruptcy Processing**: When a player is bankrupt, their assets return to the Bank.  

---

### **Step 4: Dice Roll Contract - Random Movement (Optional)**  
- **Generates random dice rolls** using Chainlink VRF or a verifiable randomness function.  
- **Stores dice results** on-chain to prevent manipulation.  

---

### **Step 5: Auction & Trade Contract - Property Transactions (Optional)**  
- **Enables property auctions** where players can bid on properties.  
- **Handles direct trades** between players without bank intervention.

## **4️⃣ Summary of Workflow**  

| Step | Frontend | Backend | Smart Contracts |
|------|---------|---------|----------------|
| **1. Game Creation** | Players create/join a game | Store metadata (optional) | Bank contract registers the game |
| **2. Money Distribution** | UI shows starting money | - | MonopolyToken distributes money |
| **3. Dice Roll** | Player rolls dice | - | Dice Roll contract generates randomness |
| **4. Property Transactions** | Players buy, sell, and trade properties | - | MonopolyProperty handles ownership |
| **5. Rent & Payments** | UI updates balances | - | Bank contract processes payments |
| **6. Mortgage & Bankruptcy** | Players mortgage/sell assets | - | Bank contract manages bankrupt players |
| **7. Game End** | Declare winner | Update player statistics | - |
